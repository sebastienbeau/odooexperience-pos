feature:
- replace the pos_order by the sale_order:

advantage:

# Implementation Feeback

## Advantage

- Fully integrated with our ERP
- Easy to set up
- Client side application in browser (easy to maintain)
- Extendable

and V9 version improves a lot the POS ;)

---
# Implementation Feeback

## "Inconvenient"

- many accounting entries generated (improvement soon)
- still young solution (not a lot of feedback)
- need benchmark (how many product can be supported 20K is ok, 100K?)
- starting the POS can be long if you have a lot of products/partners

---
# Take care

## SD card stability and Raspberry

- Shutdown can corrupt your SD cart
- ideally avoid writting on SD cart (mount RAM log partition)
- look at here before buying a SD cart : http://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards

---

# My recommendation

## Big projet

- Think about using all in one Computer using ubuntu or other linux distribution
- use pywebdriver installed on POS
- manage your customer POS (landscape, chef, puppet...)

## Small Projet

- Use the cheapest solution (raspberry with existing computer)
- Do not waste time by configuring your own posbox, buy it (with redundency), Odoo sell it
